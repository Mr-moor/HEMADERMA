# hemaderma flutter app with chatgpt4 integration // coming soon

This is a Flutter-based mobile application that serves as a medical app and a tool for creating anemia and skin problems awareness, allowing users to browse,view images,contents and in near future conduct a scan on either their skin,toes,fingernails,eyes and palms in order to determine if they may be having a medical condition related to blood or skin. 

The app will be integrated with chatGPT4 to enable  identification of any underlying issues through image scanning.

## Features

- For hematocrit one is required to scan or upload images of fingernails,palms and eyes on which the combined data is used by the AI to come up with accurate data.

- For dermatology, one is only required to scan the affected area(s) or upload image(s) on which the AI scrutinizes through for any underlying problems.
